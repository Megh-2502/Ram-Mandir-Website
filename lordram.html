                        of Vishnu') of Vishnu.
                        and some Hindus view Rama as Para Brahman (lit. 'The ultimate Brahman').
                        Rama holds huge significance in Hindu culture and religion. In Rama avatar, Vishnu is not
                        supposed
                        to
                        exhibit any of his divine potencies and lead life as a human.
                        Therefore, based on the sixteen qualities of Rama mentioned by Narada to Valmiki, the author of
                        Ramayana, the Astika Hindus view Rama as Puruṣottama (lit. 'The ideal man'),
                        Vigrahavān dharmaḥ (lit. 'Embodiment of Dharma') and Ādi Puruṣa (lit. 'The Purusha mentioned in
